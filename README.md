COINX & USDX

USDx was created on 03.30.2021 as a Burst Blockchain Asset.  Burst rebranded as the Signum Blockchain so USDx now exsists within Signum.
    The USDx Token existing within Signum is not the USDX connected to the Kava, Atom, or Cosmos Projects.  They are two completely different Tokens.
    At this time consideration is being given to decommissioning the USDx Signum Asset to avoid any confusion with the Kava, Atom, or Cosmos Projects.
    If USDx is not decommissioned it will be used for highly specialized Peer to Peer Projects.
    
    
COINx was created on 11.17.2021 as a Signum Blockchain Asset and potential alternative to USDx.
